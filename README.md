# Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp

I'm using this repository to document my progress as I work through [The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) which was developed by Colt Steele, a former bootcamp instructor at Galvanize San Francisco.

By dedicating 30-40 hours per week on this course, it's my goal to learn the relevant technologies to land a position as a front-end web developer.
